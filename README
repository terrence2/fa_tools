FA Tools
===

A digital archeology project to better understand the design and implementation
of the Fighters Anthology (FA) game engine.

FA was a flightsim released in 1997 by EA under the Jane's(r) Combat Simulations
label as a rollup and re-release of the six prior games implemented in the same
engine: USNF, USNF Marine Fighers, ATF, ATF Nato Fighters, ATF Gold, and
USNF'97. Although released in 1997 and listing a 90Mhz pentium under the minimum
system requirements, the engine actually dates back to 1994 and ran on a 486,
although with lower resolution resources.

When it was released 20 years ago, USNF was a groundbreaking piece of technology
that pushed the limits of what could be done with a computer. While it may look
antiquated to modern eyes, the engineering compromises that allowed it to run on
machines of that era are no less fascinating today.
